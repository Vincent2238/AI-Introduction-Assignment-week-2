Week 2 Assignment: AI for Sustainable Development
Theme: "Machine Learning Meets the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)" üåçü§ñ
________________________________________
Objective
Design a machine learning model or AI-driven solution that addresses one of the UN SDGs using concepts from Week 2 (e.g., supervised/unsupervised learning, neural networks, NLP, or reinforcement learning). Your project should demonstrate how AI can contribute to solving global challenges like poverty, climate change, or inequality.

Need Help?
‚Ä¢	Use Week 2 materials (quiz answers, slides) for ML concepts.
‚Ä¢	Post questions in the forum with hashtag #SDGAssignment.
‚Ä¢	Check out Google Colab for cloud-based coding.
________________________________________
Submission
‚Ä¢	Share your GitHub repo (include Intro Readme file with screenshots  of the project demo and .py files) to finish the assignment.
‚Ä¢	Write an article of your project explaining the SDG problem you are solving and how your project brings a fitting solution to the problem. Share this article on the PLP Academy Community on the LMS.
‚Ä¢	Create a compelling elevation pitch deck for your project and share on the Groups for Peer Reviews.

Assignment Structure
1. Choose Your SDG and Problem
Pick one SDG and a specific problem within it. Examples:
‚Ä¢	SDG 3 (Health): Predict disease outbreaks using health data.
‚Ä¢	SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities): Optimize public transport routes with clustering.
‚Ä¢	SDG 13 (Climate Action): Forecast carbon emissions using regression.
2. Select an ML Approach
‚Ä¢	Supervised Learning: Predict outcomes (e.g., crop yields for SDG 2: Zero Hunger).
‚Ä¢	Unsupervised Learning: Cluster data (e.g., group regions by pollution levels for SDG 6: Clean Water).
‚Ä¢	Reinforcement Learning: Simulate sustainable resource allocation (e.g., energy distribution).
3. Dataset & Tools
‚Ä¢	Datasets: Use free, open-source data (e.g., World Bank Open Data, UN SDG Database, or Kaggle).
‚Ä¢	Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
4. Build Your Model
‚Ä¢	Preprocess Data: Clean, normalize, and split data.
‚Ä¢	Train Model: Use techniques like decision trees, CNNs, or NLP (e.g., sentiment analysis of social media for SDG 5: Gender Equality).
‚Ä¢	Evaluate: Apply metrics (accuracy, MAE, F1-score) and visualize results.
5. Ethical Reflection
‚Ä¢	How might bias in your data affect outcomes?
‚Ä¢	How does your solution promote fairness and sustainability?

Deliverables
1.	Code: A Python notebook or script with comments explaining your workflow.
2.	Report: A 1-page summary of:
o	SDG problem addressed.
o	ML approach used (e.g., "K-means clustering for urban waste analysis").
o	Results and ethical considerations.
3.	Presentation: A 5-minute demo showcasing your model‚Äôs impact.

Example Projects
‚Ä¢	SDG 7 (Clean Energy): Predict solar energy potential using weather data (supervised learning).
‚Ä¢	SDG 4 (Education): Cluster students by learning patterns to recommend resources (unsupervised learning).
‚Ä¢	SDG 15 (Life on Land): Use CNNs to detect deforestation in satellite images.
________________________________________
Stretch Goals
‚Ä¢	Integrate real-time data via APIs (e.g., weather or social media feeds).
‚Ä¢	Deploy your model as a web app (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit).
‚Ä¢	Compare multiple ML algorithms to optimize performance.
